# Authorization



Authorization requires using `Authorization` header inside GET/POST requests. qBittorrent uses the standard Digest Authorization type (using a MD5 hash generator).

For example on Python using [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/):

```
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth

response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8080/command/download', {'urls': magnet_link}, auth=HTTPDigestAuth(username, password))
if not response.ok:
    response.raise_for_status()
response.content
```



1. Digest Authorization standard

[This page](http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/security/draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-00.txt) describes how this auth method should ideally work. The most important thing there is `response` field generation. Response is generated like this: `MD5 ( A1 + ':' + nonce + ':' + A2 )` where
A1 is `MD5 (username + ':' + realm + ':' + password)`
A2 is `MD5 (<method type string (e.g. GET or POST)> + ':' + uri)`

1. Server Auth response

When you fail Authorization or don't supply required header qBittorrent will send the following reply (example):

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Web UI Access", nonce="a3f396f2dcc1cafae73637e2ac321134", opaque="a3f396f2dcc1cafae73637e2ac321134", stale="false", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth"
```



`nonce` and `opaque` values will be random, nevertheless it looks like matching them is not required for successful authorization - qBittorrent doesn't track user session.

1. Client Auth request

We will now generate our request to the server containing proper Authorization header based on the example above.

1. User-Agent

   You can place whatever you want as user agent, it is not required anyway.
   `User-Agent: Fiddler`

2. Host

   Server address or domain name.
   `Host: 127.0.0.1`

3. Authorization

   This header is required.

   ```
   
   ```

   

Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="Web UI Access", nonce="a3f396f2dcc1cafae73637e2ac321134", uri="/", response="4067cfe4c029cd00b56076c78abd034c" ```

```
  All fields in this header are required. Since `nonce` is not tracked by qBittorrent you should MD5-generate it yourself either one-time or each time you do any request. `uri` is not checked, if you want to GET host/someurl and `uri` doesn't match this value - no problem, just remember that `uri` is used in `response` generation.

  In Short: **You don't need a previous server reply in order to generate a proper request.**

  You must supply Authorization header in any POST/GET request you issue.
```



1. End Result

   Server reply:

   ```
   
   ```

   

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Web UI Access", nonce="a3f396f2dcc1cafae73637e2ac321134", opaque="a3f396f2dcc1cafae73637e2ac321134", stale="false", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth" ```

```
  Client request:

  ```http
```



GET / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Fiddler Host: 127.0.0.1 Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="Web UI Access", nonce="a3f396f2dcc1cafae73637e2ac321134", uri="/", response="4067cfe4c029cd00b56076c78abd034c" ```

# GET methods

```



### Get torrent list



```
GET /json/torrents HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Fiddler
Host: 127.0.0.1
Authorization: your_auth_string
```



Server will return the following reply (example):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/javascript
content-length: length

[{"hash":"0283b35cc14387a4f6d01de33aa012fb1b740df6","name":"Sword of the Stars II Enhanced Edition","size":"1.8 ГиБ","progress":1,"dlspeed":"0 Б/с","upspeed":"0 Б/с","priority":"*","num_seeds":"0","num_leechs":"0","ratio":"0.1","eta":"∞","state":"stalledUP"},{another_torrent_info}]
```



where

`hash` - torrent hash; most queries will use torrent hash as parameter
`name` - torrent name
`size` - size of files and folders in torrent selected for download; possible values:

1. `Unknown` - this may happen, which means qBt couldn't determine torrent size for some reason
2. `X suffix` - X B/KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB

Proper suffix is appended automatically by qBt.

`progress` - float number for download completion percentage, where 1 == 100%, 0 == 0%, and, 0.58 == 58%
`dlspeed` and `upspeed`: torrent download and upload speed respectively, possible values:

1. `Unknown` - qBt couldn't determine torrent speed for some reason
2. `X suffix/s` - X B/KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB

`priority` - torrent number in priority queue; contains `*` if queuing is disabled or torrent is in seed mode
`num_seeds` and `num_leechs` - number of peers and lecchers
`ratio` - Uploaded/Downloaded ratio, rounded to first digit after comma; contains `∞` if ratio > 100
`eta` - contains `∞` if torrent is seeding only or eta >= 8640000 seconds; possible values:

1. `0` - zero
2. `< 1m` - less than a minute
3. `MMm` - MM minutes
4. `HHh MMm` - HH hours and MM minutes
5. `DDd HHh` - DD days and HH hours

DD/HH/MM values can be truncated if first digit is zero

`state` - torrent state, possible values:

1. `error` - some error occurred, applies to paused torrents
2. `pausedUP` - torrent is paused and has finished downloading
3. `pausedDL` - torrent is paused and has **NOT** finished downloading
4. `queuedUP` - queuing is enabled and torrent is queued for upload
5. `queuedDL` - queuing is enabled and torrent is queued for download
6. `uploading` - torrent is being seeded and data is being transferred
7. `stalledUP` - torrent is being seeded, but no connection were made
8. `checkingUP` - torrent has finished downloading and is being checked; this status also applies to preallocation (if enabled) and checking resume data on qBt startup
9. `checkingDL` - same as `checkingUP`, but torrent has **NOT** finished downloading
10. `downloading` - torrent is being downloaded and data is being transferred
11. `stalledDL` - torrent is being downloaded, but no connection were made

**BIG FAT WARNING:** `size`, `dlspeed`, `upspeed` and `eta` suffixes (e.g. MiB, KiB/s) will depend on current language selected in qBt; these suffixes will be translated.

**BIG FAT WARNING 2:** Raw data this methods provides can exceed 40 KiB for ~200 torrents. Continuous polling is strongly discouraged for mobile clients.

2. When setting preferences `scan_dirs` must **always** be accompanied with `download_in_scan_dirs`
3. Paths in `scan_dirs` must exist, otherwise this option will have no effect
4. String values must be quoted; integer and boolean values must never be quoted

# Additional information



### Version 3.0.8 bugs



The following WebUI-related bugs exist in qBittorent v3.0.8 and lower:

1. JSON generation bugs

- `'` and `&` (apostrophe and ampersand) characters are escaped by backslash `\`

1. JSON parsing bugs

- When [setting qBittorent preferences](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/WebUI-API-(qBittorrent-v3.1.x)#setpref) JSON values, containing `:` semicolons will be disregarded; this mostly affects Windows users, whose paths start with `DiskName:\`
- When [setting qBittorent preferences](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/WebUI-API-(qBittorrent-v3.1.x)#setpref) JSON bool lists (e.g. `"download_in_scan_dirs":[false,true]`) will be treated as all bool values in the list are `false`, this doesn't affect bool values outside JSON lists
